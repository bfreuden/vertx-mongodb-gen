InsertOneResult has an insertedId with an Object type?
FindOption setSort -> sort
Promise.promise() vs vertx.promise()?
handler async result functions fluent or void?
create an ObjectID class?
don't ignore <TResult> Class<TResult> methods?
  maybe create a VersatileMongoCollection interface with them?
force batch size to 1 in mongoresult when not provided?
  because the mongo driver will probably choose a good batch size anyway and actually batch them in the publisher?
really support objectid=false?
